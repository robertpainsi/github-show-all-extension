## Chrome Extension to load all diffs and show outdated comments
(not using Chrome, see [#not-using-chrome](https://github.com/robertpainsi/github-show-all-extension#not-using-chrome))

This plugin will show a new context menu item only on pull request pages. Right click on the page and click on ":octocat: Load all".

* Conversation tab → Shows all outdated comments
* Files changed tab → Loads all diffs
  * Note: You may need to load all files into the view first by scrolling to the end of the page.

### NOT USING CHROME?

No problem, just c&p the code from [index.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertpainsi/github-show-all-extension/master/index.js) into the browser console and press enter.
